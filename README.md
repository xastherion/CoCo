# CoCo ðŸ¥¥

## A GUI for shell commands saved on a simple container.

Sure, a experienced Console-User know a lot of shell commands, but the options too?, and the syntax? and the last used variables, etc. etc. etc.

Sure, you can find old commands on history... but from wich shell? from wich server/client?, was that linux, macos, bsd, or ps? and so and so on.

I know, it is a lot of very nice filemanagers as nc or mc, but they donÂ´t allow you to organize your favorites shell commands in so a way. They do it for you but they dont help you to know how do you can do it. Because of them, Do it! is the way of CoCo. :-)

CoCo allow you to save and export easily all your favorites shell commands (and anothers like python too) in a GUI interface for many Operativ Systems compatible.

A confortable place to put favorites commands for direct execution or copy&amp;paste.

A am still working on:
- a no-tk platform for only-text systems based on python "dialog"
- a shell history-browser inbound on script
- a way to save CoCo and dependecies, or at least their databank (comandos.csv) on a online service like webdav maybe.
- a way to organize a lot of commands, like "disk tools" "user tools" "file managemen" and so on.

If you find CoCo usefull, and you have some ideen or comments about it i would be glad to ear it.
