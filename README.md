# CoCo

## A GUI f√ºr shell commands saved on a simple container.

Sure, a experienced Console-User know a lot of shell commands, but the options too?, and the syntax? and the last used variables, etc. etc. etc.

Sure, you can see on history... but from wich shell? from wich server/client?, was that linux, macos, bsd, or ps? and so and so on.

CoCo allow you to save and export easily all your favorites shell commands (and another like python too) in a GUI interface for many Operativ Systems compatible.

A confortable place to put favorites commands for direct execution or copy&amp;paste.

A am still working on:
- a no-tk platform for only-text systems based on python "dialog"
- a shell history-browser inbound on script
- a way to save CoCo and dependecies, or at least their databank (comandos.csv) on a online service like webdav maybe.

If you find CoCo usefull, and you have some ideen or comment i would be glad to ear it.
